SideInfo: TypeAlias = dict[str, Any]
"""
Auxiliary evaluation information that powers LLM-based reflection in GEPA optimization.

SideInfo is a dictionary returned alongside each evaluation score from your fitness function.
It contains rich diagnostic information that GEPA's reflective mutation proposer uses to
understand what went wrong and generate targeted improvements to candidates. The more
informative your SideInfo, the more effective the LLM-guided optimization becomes.

**Role in the Optimization Loop:**

1. Your fitness_fn evaluates a candidate and returns (score, rollout_output, side_info)
2. GEPA collects side_info across multiple evaluation instances
3. The reflective proposer presents this information to an LLM with the candidate parameters
4. The LLM analyzes failures/successes and proposes parameter improvements
5. New candidates are generated and the cycle repeats

**Structure:**

SideInfo has two primary components:

1. **Multi-dimensional Scores** (optional, via "scores" field):
    Additional numeric metrics beyond the main fitness score, used for multi-objective
    optimization and providing quantitative feedback to the reflection LLM.
    
    - Must be specified as: {"scores": {"metric1": value1, "metric2": value2, ...}}
    - All scores must follow "higher is better" convention (invert if needed)
    - Enables Pareto-optimal candidate selection across multiple objectives
    - Example: {"scores": {"accuracy": 0.85, "speed": 12.5, "robustness": 0.72}}

2. **Contextual Information** (all other fields):
    Qualitative and quantitative information that helps the LLM understand the evaluation
    context and guide parameter improvements. Can include text, numbers, or structured data.
    
    Example fields:
    - "Input" / "Inputs": The input(s) provided to the candidate
    - "Output" / "Outputs": What the candidate actually produced
    - "Expected" / "ExpectedOutput": Ground truth or desired output, if available
    - "Feedback": Qualitative assessment of candidate performance. Can be human-written or machine-generated.
    - "Error" / "ErrorMessage": Parsing / Compilation / Execution / Other errors or failure descriptions
    - "Reasoning": Step-by-step reasoning trace or intermediate computations
    - "ProfilerData": Performance profiling information
    - "ValidationErrors": Schema validation or constraint violations
    
    Design principle: Include anything that would help a human understand why the
    candidate succeeded or failed on this instance. Be descriptive in field names and values.

**Parameter-Specific Information** (optional):

For multi-parameter optimization, you can provide targeted diagnostic information for
individual parameters using "<param_name>_specific_info" fields. This is especially
useful when different parameters have different failure modes.

- Format: {"<param_name>_specific_info": <nested_SideInfo_dict>}
- The nested dict can contain its own "scores" and contextual fields
- During reflection on parameter X, GEPA combines:
    * All top-level SideInfo fields (shared context)
    * The "<X>_specific_info" fields (parameter-specific context)
- Use cases: parsing errors, parameter-specific constraints, component-level metrics

**Complete Example:**

```python
{
    # Multi-objective scores
    "scores": {
        "accuracy": 0.73,
        "response_time_ms": 850,  # Already inverted (higher=better)
        "user_satisfaction": 4.2
    },
    
    # Shared evaluation context
    "Input": "Translate 'Hello world' to French",
    "Output": "Salut monde",
    "Expected": "Bonjour le monde",
    "Feedback": "Translation is too informal for the context",
    "ExecutionTime": 0.85, # Numeric value, still useful for context, but not "higher is better".
    
    # Parameter-specific diagnostics
    "system_prompt_specific_info": {
        "scores": {
            "tone_appropriateness": 0.3  # Low score explains the issue
        },
        "ParsedTone": "casual",
        "ExpectedTone": "formal",
        "Analysis": "System prompt led to overly casual translation"
    },
    
    "temperature_specific_info": {
        "Feedback": "Temperature 0.9 caused inconsistent outputs"
    }
}
```

**Best Practices:**

- **Be generous with information**: More context = better LLM reflection
- **Include failures prominently**: Error messages and failure reasons are crucial
- **Use consistent field names**: Helps the LLM recognize patterns across evaluations
- **Normalize scores**: Ensure "higher is better" for all metrics in "scores"
- **Add context for metrics**: Don't just say accuracy=0.7, explain what was wrong
- **Use parameter-specific info judiciously**: Only when you have parameter-targeted insights

**Integration with Fitness Function:**

Your fitness_fn should construct SideInfo for each evaluation instance. See the
FitnessFn protocol documentation for the complete evaluation interface.

        """
        Core evaluation interface for GEPA optimization.

        Evaluates a candidate (parameterized system) on a single example,
        returning a score and diagnostic information that guide the optimization process.

        **Parameters:**

        - **candidate**: Dictionary mapping parameter names to values representing one
          system configuration.

          Examples:
          - Prompt optimization: `{"system_prompt": "You are...", "user_prefix": "Answer:"}`
          - Hyperparameter tuning: `{"learning_rate": "0.001", "batch_size": "32"}`
          - Multi-component system: `{"component_1_config": "...", "component_2_config": "..."}`

        - **example**: A single example from the dataset to evaluate on (test case,
          input-output pair, task instance). In single-instance mode (when `dataset=None`
          is passed to `optimize_anything`), this parameter will be `None`.

        - **kwargs**: Additional keyword arguments passed during evaluation.

        **Returns:**

        A 3-tuple containing the evaluation result:

        1. **score** (float): Fitness score for this instance. Higher is better. Must be finite.
           Primary optimization signal.

        2. **rollout_output** (RolloutOutput): Actual output produced by the candidate.
           Opaque to GEPA—only tracked for returning best outputs per data instance in
           GEPAResult. Can be any type (str, dict, custom object).

        3. **side_info** (SideInfo): Auxiliary evaluation information powering LLM-based
           reflection. See SideInfo documentation for detailed guidance on structure and
           best practices.

        **Requirements:**

        - Include rich diagnostic information in side_info for effective reflection
        - All scores follow "higher is better" convention

        **Single-Instance Mode (Holistic Optimization):**

        When `dataset=None` is passed to `optimize_anything`, the fitness function is called
        with `example=None`. For single-instance problems like code evolution or mathematical
        optimization, simply ignore the `example` parameter:

        ```python
        def fitness_fn(candidate, example=None):
            # example is None in single-instance mode - ignore it
            result = execute_my_code(candidate["code"])
            score = compute_score(result)
            return score, result, {"Output": str(result)}

    Optimize any parameterized system using evolutionary algorithms with LLM-based reflection.

    This is the main entry point for GEPA optimization. It accepts a seed candidate (initial
    parameter configuration), a fitness function for evaluation, and optionally a dataset
    of test cases.

    **Two modes of operation:**

    1. **Per-instance mode** (when `dataset` is provided): The fitness function is called
       once per example in the dataset, and scores are aggregated. This is ideal for
       prompt optimization, supervised learning tasks, etc.

    2. **Single-instance mode** (default, when `dataset=None`): For optimization problems like
       code evolution or circle packing where there's no dataset—just a single optimization
       target defined implicitly by the fitness function. The fitness function receives
       `example=None`, which can be ignored.

    Args:
        seed_candidate: Initial candidate(s) to start optimization from. Can be a single
            candidate dict or a list of candidates for population-based initialization.
        fitness_fn: Function that evaluates a candidate on a single example, returning
            (score, output, side_info). See FitnessFn protocol for details.
            In single-instance mode, the `example` argument will be `None`.
        dataset: List of examples/test cases to evaluate candidates on during optimization.
            If None, operates in single-instance mode where the optimization target is
            defined entirely within the fitness function (e.g., code evolution, mathematical
            optimization). Default: None.
        valset: Optional separate validation set. If not provided, uses dataset for validation.
        objective: High-level description of what the optimized component should achieve.
            Used to generate a reflection prompt that guides the LLM proposer. Example:
            "Generate Python code that solves competitive programming problems efficiently."
            Cannot be used together with a custom reflection_prompt_template in config.
        background: Domain knowledge, constraints, algorithms, or implementation requirements
            that should guide optimization. Used alongside objective to generate reflection
            prompts. Example: "Solutions must use only standard library. Time limit is 2 seconds.
            Consider dynamic programming and greedy approaches." Cannot be used together with
            a custom reflection_prompt_template in config.
        config: Optional GEPAConfig for fine-grained control over optimization behavior.
            If not provided, uses sensible defaults.

    Returns:
        GEPAResult containing the best candidate(s), optimization history, and metrics.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If both objective/background and a custom reflection_prompt_template
            are provided (mutually exclusive options).

    Example (per-instance mode):
        >>> result = optimize_anything(
        ...     seed_candidate={"prompt": "Solve this math problem:"},
        ...     fitness_fn=my_evaluator,
